    " - Initial State: The algorithm begins with the assumption that the first element in the list is already sorted, as a   single element is always considered sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Iterating Through the List: The algorithm starts iterating from the second element (index 1) to the last element    (index n-1), where n is the total number of elements in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Insertion Process: For each element at the current iteration, the algorithm compares it with the elements to its left (already sorted portion of the list). It then moves the current element to its correct position within the sorted portion by shifting the larger elements to the right until the correct position is found for the current element.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Shifting Elements: While comparing and shifting, the algorithm essentially creates an empty space for the current element to be inserted. This space is created by shifting larger elements to the right. This process continues until the correct position for the current element is found.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Inserting the Element: Once the correct position is identified, the current element is placed in that position, filling the empty space created during the shifting process.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Iteration Continues: The algorithm then moves on to the next element (incrementing the iteration index) and repeats the insertion process until all elements are processed.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Final Sorted List: Once all iterations are complete, the entire list is sorted in ascending (or descending) order."

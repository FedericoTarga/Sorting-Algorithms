    "Shell Sort is a popular sorting algorithm that builds upon the insertion sort by dividing the input list into smaller sublists, which are then sorted using insertion sort.

    "- Generate Tokuda's Sequence: The first step is to generate the Tokuda's sequence, which consists of a series of gap values. These gap values are used to determine the intervals between elements that are compared and swapped during each pass of the Shell Sort algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Algorithm Steps:\n",
    "  - Start by initializing an index i that represents the current gap interval. Typically, you start with the largest gap from Tokuda's sequence and gradually reduce it.\n",
    "  - In each iteration, you perform an insertion sort on sublists with elements separated by the current gap. For each sublist, you iterate through the elements and compare each element with the one that is i positions before it (elements with the same gap).\n",
    "  - If the element at the earlier position is greater than the current element, you swap them. This step is similar to the insertion sort step.\n",
    "  - After you complete the insertion sort pass for the current gap, you reduce the gap index i to the next smaller gap from Tokuda's sequence and repeat the process until you have iterated through all gap values.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sorting Process: The sorting process continues as follows:\n",
    "  - Start with the largest gap from Tokuda's sequence and perform insertion sort on sublists with that gap.\n",
    "  - Gradually reduce the gap and repeat the insertion sort for each gap value in Tokuda's sequence.\n",
    "  - The final iteration should have a gap of 1, effectively performing an insertion sort on the entire list.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Completion: Once the algorithm finishes the pass with a gap of 1, the list will be sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of Tokuda's sequence: 1, 4, 9, 20, 46, 103, 233, 525, 1182, 2660...\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say you have the following unsorted list: [8, 3, 11, 5, 2, 9, 1]. Using Tokuda's sequence, you start with the largest gap (2660), then move to the next smaller gap (1182), and so on, until you reach a gap of 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that the Tokuda's sequence provides gap values, and the Shell Sort algorithm utilizes these gaps to perform more efficient insertion sorts on sublists with elements separated by those gaps. This progressive reduction of gap sizes allows the algorithm to take advantage of partially sorted data, which speeds up the overall sorting process compared to a traditional insertion sort."
